 * \journal_get_completion_state($course, $cm, $userid, true). The
 * underlying helper only checks completion when $type === COMPLETION_AND,
 * so for any other value it just returned $type unchanged. That made
 * has_answered() return true for every student regardless of whether
 * they had actually written an entry, painting the "completed" tick on
 * the course-format overview in error.
