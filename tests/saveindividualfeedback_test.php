/**
 * Static regression tests for the AJAX leaf saveindividualfeedback.php.
 *
 * Guards bug B9:
 *   - The leaf used to write into a $result array it never declared,
 *     relying on the dispatcher's $result coming through the require()
 *     scope. If the leaf is ever called from a different scope (test
 *     harness, CLI, alternative dispatcher) PHP raises an "undefined
 *     variable" notice and the JSON response is malformed.
 *   - The leaf also carried a dead `$grade !== null` clause: $grade
 *     is forced to an int by lines just above, so the null check could
 *     never fire.
 *
 * Full behavioural tests for the leaf would require exercising the
 * AJAX dispatcher + sesskey + require_login pipeline, which is heavy
 * under phpunit. The static checks below catch the most likely
 * regressions (someone deletes the local $result, someone re-adds the
 * dead null clause, someone types $grade as nullable again).
 *
